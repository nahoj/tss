# From the TagSpaces documentation:
# "TagSpaces supports tagging of files in a cross platform way. It uses basically the name of the file to save this
# kind of meta information. As an example if you want to add the tags vacation and alps to a image named IMG-2653.jpg,
# the application will simply rename it to IMG-2653[vacation alps].jpg."
